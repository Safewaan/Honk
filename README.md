# HonkedIn
Welcome to the HonkedIn repository! HonkedIn is a web application built with React and Node.js to provide students with a platform for networking and building communities. 

## Version Control Guide

### Branching
* Branch off of `main` for all feature work and bug fixes, creating a "feature branch". Prefix the feature branch name with your name. The branch name should be in kebab case and it should be short and descriptive. E.g. `Safewaan/readme-update`

### Commits
* Commits should be atomic (guideline: the commit is self-contained; a reviewer could make sense of it even if they viewed the commit diff in isolation)
* Trivial commits (e.g. fixing a typo in the previous commit, formatting changes) should be squashed or fixup'd into the last non-trivial commit
* PRs can contain multiple commits, they do not need to be squashed together before merging as long as each commit is atomic. Our repo is configured to only allow squash commits to `main` so the entire PR will appear as 1 commit on `main`, but the individual commits are preserved when viewing the PR.
